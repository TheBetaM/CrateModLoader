## Crash Twinsanity Editor
>Original version made by Neo_Kesha

## Description
This is a rewrite of the Crash Twinsanity Editor, simply called TwinsanityEditor (TE). The original version was written in VB (Visual Basic), and this is a repo of the version that was converted to C#.

## Current issues
The state of the editor right now is unusable for editing (please use the old version for actual proper editing for now). The only working features right now are loading RM/SM files, viewing certain parameters, and collision and object instance placement and that's pretty much it.

Here's the list of what needs to be fixed:
- [ ] Model viewing
- [x] Collision viewing
- [ ] Scenery viewing
- [ ] Sound playback
- [ ] Fully functional editing GUI
- [ ] Ditch any unnecessery dependencies (OpenTK should suffice for sounds and graphics)
- [ ] General code refactoring and rewriting (having 6k lines of code doesn't seem practical)
- [ ] More API optimizations?
- [ ] A lot of other smaller stuff

## Compiling
Just open your project in VisualStudio 2017 (2015 might work, untested) and compile it.
